# Name and origins

The name is inspired by a italian dish: "Sarde in saor".

They are a typical Venetian appetizer made with fried sardines that are dipped in "saor", a tasty condiment based on onions, pine nuts, vinegar and raisins. This seasoning mix might turn some people off, but I can assure you that it's not that bad when you try it. In any case, I chose this name in fact because of the difficulty 
and the time it takes to prepare this dish, just like an operating system.

### What is Cosmos?

[Cosmos](https://github.com/CosmosOS/Cosmos)  (C# Open Source Managed Operating System) is an operating system development kit which uses .NET, alongside the custom IL2CPU compiler to convert (most) C# code into a working bare-metal OS.

Saor it's made possible by Cosmos and all of its contributors, so it's not built from zero.

Like every Cosmos based OS (Some of them can be found [here](https://github.com/AnErrupTion/cosmos-awesome)) it has the same hardware compatibility and the same limitations, so don't expect this OS to be superior, especially because most of the code is took and modified from other Cosmos OSes.
